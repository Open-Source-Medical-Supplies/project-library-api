# Project Library API

This repository contains the source code for the Open Source Medical Supplies Project Library API.

## Overview

This project uses [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) to store the project library data in a Postgresql we that can be easily queried and modified. The project also leverages serverless functions, located in the `supabase/functions` folder. Each function is written in [Deno](https://deno.land/) and deployed through the Supabase Edge Functions framework.

## Linking Project 

```
supabase link --project-ref PROJECT_REF
```

## Project Structure

Below is a description of the structure and purpose of the included files and directories:

### 1. `supabase/config.toml`
Contains configuration for the Supabase environment, including database connection details and other project-specific settings.

### 2. `supabase/migrations/*`
SQL files (or other migration scripts) that help manage and version-control changes to the database schema. For instance:
- `20250227024942_remote_schema.sql` â€“ A database migration script.

### 3. `supabase/functions`
This directory contains Deno-based serverless functions. Each function is a small module that can be called via an HTTP request. Important sub-folders include:

- **`categories/`**
  - `index.ts`: A Supabase edge function that queries the `categories` table in the database. It accepts JSON with optional fields:
    - `search`: A string to filter category names via case-insensitive matching.
    - `categoryTokens`: A comma-separated list of token values. The function will return all categories whose tokens match the provided list.

  - `deno.json`: Provides metadata and dependencies for the Deno environment.

- **`search/`**
  - `index.ts`: A simple example function that logs a message and returns a JSON response with a `"message"` field. It shows how to handle a POST request and send a JSON response.

  - `deno.json`: Similar to above, houses metadata for the search function.

- **`sync/`** *(not fully displayed here)*
  - Might be used to synchronize data with another system.

- **`projects/`** *(not fully displayed here)*
  - Another function that can connect to or manage a `projects` table.

- **`shared/`**
  - `cors.ts`: A small shared utility to insert necessary CORS headers, enabling cross-origin requests.

- **`tests/`**
  - `search-test.ts`: Potentially a test suite for the `search` function. This may include an example of how to test edge functions locally.

### 4. Additional files
- `package.json` / `package-lock.json`: Standard npm configurations, possibly used for local development or other scripts.

## Data Models

- `Projects`
- `Categories`
- `ProjectTags`

## API Endpoints

- `/functions/v1/projects`
- `/functions/v1/categories`

## Environment Setup

You will need to setup a couple environment variables to be able to connect to the Supabase platform. You will need to be invited to the Supabase project to get the credentials to pull from the production instance and deploy changes to the functions.

## Supabase Configuration

1. **Supabase Configuration**: The `config.toml` file and the migrations in `supabase/migrations` define how the database tables and environment are set up. You can apply these migrations using the Supabase CLI.

2. **Functions**: 
   - Each function is an isolated endpoint that can be deployed by running `supabase functions deploy <function-name>`.
   - Deno automatically reads the `index.ts` file in each function subdirectory as its entry point.
   - Any environment variables (like `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) are provided at runtime.

3. **Database Interaction**:
   - The code uses `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`. This allows secure, direct querying of your Supabase PostgreSQL database.
   - For example, the "categories" function filters data by name (matching a user-provided `search` string) or by tokens in the `categoryTokens` field. Results are then returned as JSON.

4. **CORS Support**:
   - `corsHeaders` imported from `cors.ts` helps ensure that cross-domain requests are permitted. If your front-end or other external services call these functions, including these headers is essential.

### Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) installed.
   - [Deno](https://deno.land/) (optional if you want local dev and testing outside of Supabase CLI tools).

2. **Local Development**:
   - Clone the repository.
   - Pull the latest state of the DB `supabase db pull`.
   - Run `supabase start` to launch Supabase locally.
   - Within each function folder (e.g., `supabase/functions/categories`), you can start the functions `supabase functions serve`.

3. **Testing Functions**:
   - You can test functions locally using `curl` or a tool like Postman.
   ```Shell
   curl --request POST 'http://localhost:54321/functions/v1/END_POINT' \
      --header 'Authorization: Bearer SUPABASE_ANON_KEY' \
      --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
      --data '{ "ping":"pong" }'
   ```

4. **Connecting other repositories**
    - Starting up Supabase locally will output the connection details needed for testing and performing migrations
    - You can use the variables in the .env files in the [project-library-client](https://github.com/Open-Source-Medical-Supplies/project-library-client) and [project-library-data](https://github.com/Open-Source-Medical-Supplies/project-library-data) repositories.

5. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy functions to your Supabase project:

     ```bash
     supabase functions deploy projects
     supabase functions deploy categories
     ```
   - The functions will be accessible at `https://<your-project>.functions.supabase.co/<function-name>`.
